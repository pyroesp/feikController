# feikController

feikController is a PIC16F18325 emulating a PlayStation 1 controller.  
I wanted to make this into a library but it's too device specific.  
I'm using a cheap pedal button as input to the 16F18325, which send data to the PlayStation 1 to emulate a press on the X button.  


## Disclaimer

This has been tested on my PlayStation 1 and it seems to be working fine.  
However, I am not responsible if for some reason your PlayStation gets damaged by using or installing this.  

You use this at your own risk.  

## Why

A while back I found out you could use a second controller in Time Crisis 1 to work as an arcade pedal.  
I recently made the PlayStation 1 reset mod with the 16F18325 so I was confident I could emulate a controller.  

That's how this idea came to be, and it seems to be working quite well.  
Here's a demo of the pedal controller : ![https://youtu.be/5PXXQ49MqOc](https://youtu.be/5PXXQ49MqOc)
